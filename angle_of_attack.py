The angle of attack is defined as the angle between the velocity of the disc
and the plane of the frisbee.

To calculate the angle of attack:

1. Create lab-frame velocity vector ([vx,vy,vz])
2. Determine which column or row of rotation matrix represents inertial coordinates
of z-body unit vector
3. Calculate dot product of z-body unit vector and velocity vector; this dot product
is the scalar component of the velocity that is not in the plane of the disc
4. Calculate the velocity in the plane of the disc by subtracting the above dot product times
the z-body unit vector from the lab-frame velocity.
